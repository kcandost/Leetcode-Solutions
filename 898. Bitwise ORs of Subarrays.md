# Intuition
OR accumulates bits, so for subarrays ending at position i you only need to consider ORs of subarrays ending at i-1 and extend them with arr[i], plus the singleton arr[i]. Keeping only distinct ORs ending at each position keeps the state small (bounded by bit-width).

# Approach
- Maintain `prev`: set of all distinct ORs of subarrays ending at the previous index.
- For each element `a` in `arr`, compute `curr = {a | x for x in prev} âˆª {a}`: all subarrays ending here.
- Add `curr` to a global result set.
- Slide: `prev = curr`.
- Return size of result set.

# Complexity
- Time: $$\mathcal{O}(n \cdot B)$$ where \(B\) is the number of bits in the maximum value (â‰ˆ30), since `prev` stays small.
- Space: $$\mathcal{O}(n \cdot B)$$ in worst case for the result set, but per-iteration auxiliary is $$\mathcal{O}(B)$$.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        res = set()
        prev = set()
        for a in arr:
            curr = {a | x for x in prev} | {a}
            res |= curr
            prev = curr
        return len(res)
