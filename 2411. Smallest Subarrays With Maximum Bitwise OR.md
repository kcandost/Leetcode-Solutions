[LC.2411](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subarrays-with-maximum-bitwise-or/description/)

## Intuition
When you add a new element at position `i` to any subarray that starts at `j < i`, the bitwise OR of that subarray can only increase or stay the same — it never decreases. Once a subarray’s OR already includes all the bits of a new element, adding that element doesn’t change the OR.  
This means we can work forward through the array and, for each `nums[i]`, walk backward and "push" its bits into earlier subarrays until those subarrays already contain them. That tells us exactly how far each starting index must extend to reach its maximum OR.

### Bitwise OR

## Bitwise OR Operation

**Overview**  
The bitwise OR (`|`) combines two integers by comparing their binary representations bit by bit. For each bit position, the result is `1` if **either** operand has a `1` in that position; otherwise it’s `0`.

---

## How It Works

1. **Binary Alignment**  
   Convert both numbers to binary, padding with leading zeros so they have the same length:
   ```text
   5  →  0101  
   3  →  0011
   ```

2. **Bit-by‑Bit Comparison**  
   Apply the OR rule (1 | 0 → 1, 0 | 1 → 1, 1 | 1 → 1, 0 | 0 → 0):
   ```text
     0101   (5)
   | 0011   (3)
   ──────
     0111   (7)
   ```

3. **Result**  
   The binary `0111` corresponds to decimal `7`, so `5 | 3 = 7`.

## Why It Matters in DSA

- **Masking & Flags**  
  Use OR to set specific bits in a mask without affecting others.

- **Combining Sets**  
  When treating each bit as membership in a small fixed-size set, OR merges two sets quickly.

- **Performance**  
  Bitwise operations run in constant time—critical in tight loops or low‑level algorithms.

---

## Quick Tips

 
- OR is **commutative**: `a | b == b | a`.  
- OR is **idempotent**: `x | x == x`.

## Approach
- Create a result array `res` initialized with all 1s — since the smallest subarray starting at any index is the element itself.  
- Also create a copy `or_acc = nums.copy()` to track the OR values for subarrays starting at each position.

For each index `i` in the array:
- Set `x = nums[i]`
- Walk backward from `j = i - 1` to `0`. For each `j`:
  - If `or_acc[j] | x != or_acc[j]`, it means `nums[i]` brings in new bits, so:
    - Update `or_acc[j] |= x`
    - Update `res[j] = i - j + 1` — this is the new length required to reach full OR
  - Stop walking when no new bits are added (`or_acc[j]` is already saturated)

This approach avoids computing suffix ORs and avoids scanning all 32 bits — it operates only on meaningful bit growth and spreads that information backward.

## Result
After finishing the forward pass, `res[i]` contains the minimum length of the subarray starting at index `i` that achieves the maximum OR possible from that position.

## Complexity
**Time Complexity:**  
$$\mathcal{O}(n)$$, each bit at each position is pushed backward only once until it’s absorbed. So although there’s a nested loop, the total number of operations is linear in practice.

**Space Complexity:**  
$$\mathcal{O}(n)$$, we use two arrays of size `n`: one for results, and one for accumulating ORs.


# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def smallestSubarrays(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        res = [1] * n
        # Use a separate OR accumulator to avoid mutating the input
        or_acc = nums.copy()

        for i in range(n):
            x = nums[i]
            j = i - 1
            # Propagate new bits of nums[i] backward until each prefix already has them
            while j >= 0 and (or_acc[j] | x) != or_acc[j]:
                or_acc[j] |= x
                res[j] = i - j + 1
                j -= 1

        return res

```
