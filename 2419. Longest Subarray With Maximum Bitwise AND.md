[LC.2419](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-with-maximum-bitwise-and/description/)

# Intuition
The maximum possible bitwise AND of any subarray is just the maximum element $$k$$ in the arrayâ€”no combination of smaller elements can exceed it. Therefore, only subarrays composed entirely of numbers that have all the bits of $$k$$. (i.e. \(x \,\&\, k)==k\) can achieve this maximum AND.

# Approach
1. Compute `k = max(nums)`.  
2. Traverse the array once, keeping a running count `cur` of how many consecutive elements satisfy \((x \,\&\, k)==k\).  
3. If the condition holds, increment `cur`; otherwise reset `cur` to 0.  
4. Track the maximum value of `cur` in `ans`.  
5. Return `ans` at the end.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$  
- Space complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$  

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def longestSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        k = max(nums)
        ans = cur = 0
        for x in nums:
            cur = cur + 1 if (x & k) == k else 0
            ans = max(ans, cur)
        return ans
