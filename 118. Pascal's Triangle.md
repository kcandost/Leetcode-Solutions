[LC.118](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/description/)

## Intuition  
Each row is built from the previous one: start and end with `1`, and interior elements are pairwise sums from the prior row.

## Approach  
 
1. Initialize result with the first row `[1]` and keep a reference to the previous row.  
2. For each subsequent row index `i` from 1 to `numRows-1`:
   - Begin the new row with `1`.  
   - For each position `j` in `1..i-1`, append `prev[j-1] + prev[j]`.  
   - End the row with `1`.  
   - Append it to the result and set `prev` to this new row.  
3. Return the accumulated triangle.

## Complexity  
- Time: $$\mathcal{O}(numRows^2)$$ — building all entries (1 + 2 + ... + numRows).  
- Space: $$\mathcal{O}(numRows^2)$$ — output size dominates; auxiliary is $$\mathcal{O}(numRows)$$ for the previous row.

## Code
```python3
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        if numRows <= 0:
            return []
        result = [[1]]
        prev = result[0]
        for i in range(1, numRows):
            row = [1]
            for j in range(1, i):
                row.append(prev[j - 1] + prev[j])
            row.append(1)
            result.append(row)
            prev = row
        return result
