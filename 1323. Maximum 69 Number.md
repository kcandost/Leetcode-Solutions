# Intuition
Convert to a string, change the first `6` to `9` you encounter, and that's it.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maximum69Number (self, num: int) -> int:
        s=str(num)
        for char in s:
            if char=='6':
                s=s.replace(char,'9',1)
                break
        return int(s)
```
