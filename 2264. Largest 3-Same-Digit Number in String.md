[LC.2264](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-3-same-digit-number-in-string/description/)

# Intuition
We only care about substrings of length 3 that consist of the same digit repeated (e.g., `"000"`, `"777"`). Among all such triples, the answer is simply the largest digit repeated three times. Since each candidate is a single digit, comparing them as strings works (e.g., `"9"` > `"7"`).

# Approach
We can use a regular expression to quickly find all such triples.  
The pattern `(\d)\1\1` means:
- `(\d)` — match a single digit (0–9) and capture it in a group.
- `\1` — match the exact same digit as captured in group 1.
- `\1` again — match that same digit a third time.

This ensures we match **exactly three of the same digit in a row**, such as `"000"`, `"777"`, etc.  
`re.findall` will return a list of the matched digits (as single characters, not the full triple). For example, with `"6777133339"`, it would return `["7", "3"]`.  
We then take the maximum digit in that list (if any) and repeat it three times for the final result. If no matches are found, we return an empty string.


# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ — where n is the length of the string. The regex engine scans the string once.

- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ in the worst case because `findall` stores all matches. This can be reduced to $$O(1)$$ auxiliary space by using `re.finditer` and tracking the maximum match on the fly.



# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def largestGoodInteger(self, num: str) -> str:
        hits = re.findall(r'(\d)\1\1', num)
        return (max(hits) * 3) if hits else ""
```
