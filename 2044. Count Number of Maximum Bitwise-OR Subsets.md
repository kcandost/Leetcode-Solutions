[LC.2044](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-maximum-bitwise-or-subsets/description/)

# Intuition
At its core, this problem asks “How many subsets achieve the same OR value as taking the OR of every element?” If you OR every number together, you get the maximum possible OR. Every subset whose OR equals that value must include enough bits to cover all those set bits. We can systematically explore all subsets and count exactly those that hit the target.

# Approach
1. **Precompute the target OR**  
   Loop once through the input and OR every element into a variable `target`. This is the highest OR any subset can reach.

2. **DFS over subset choices**  
   Define a recursive function `dfs(i, cur)` that considers whether to include or skip `nums[i]`.  
   - If `i` reaches `len(nums)`, we’ve built one complete subset; return `1` if `cur == target`, else `0`.  
   - Otherwise, recurse twice:
     - **Include** `nums[i]`: call `dfs(i+1, cur | nums[i])`
     - **Exclude** `nums[i]`: call `dfs(i+1, cur)`
   Sum the two results to accumulate the count of valid subsets.

3. **Start the recursion**  
   Call `dfs(0, 0)` to begin with an empty OR and the first index.

This brute‐force explores all \(2^n\) subsets, but with \(n \le 16\) it’s perfectly acceptable. The code is compact and leverages the call stack to track progress.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(2^n)$$ — we explore every subset once.  
- Space complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$ — recursion depth grows to \(n\).


# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def countMaxOrSubsets(self, nums):
        target = 0
        for x in nums: target |= x
        def dfs(i, cur):
            if i == len(nums): return cur == target
            return dfs(i+1, cur | nums[i]) + dfs(i+1, cur)
        return dfs(0, 0)

```
